This contains spoilers, read AFTER you read the book.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>‚ÄúThe Fault in Our Stars‚Äù (TFIOS) was first published on the 10th of January in 2012. Since then it has won many awards such as The Goodreads Choice Award for Best Young Adult Fiction in 2012. It has 317 pages and is not in a series. For me this makes it all the better. A good author has to know when their story ends. This novel is set in Indiana in America and Amsterdam in Holland. <br/>TFIOS is a romance fiction novel. It focusses on two main characters, Hazel Grace Lancaster and Augustus, or Gus, Waters with appearances of Isaac, Gus‚Äô close friend and of course the famous Peter Van Houten. All of these characters play important roles in the plot. The other characters are fillers in my opinion. <br/>I‚Äôve read some good and bad reviews of this book. Some say it‚Äôs the romance is cheesy and the plot is predictable. But I‚Äôve also read the ones written by fans. I personally liked this book. One of my favourite sayings is ‚ÄúDifferent people like different things.‚Äù I‚Äôve been using this to settle disagreements for as long as I can remember. I believe the world would be boring with the same opinions. One of my favourite genre of books is romance especially when paired with fantasy. It doesn‚Äôt matter how unrealistic it is to go to a stranger‚Äôs house after making eye contact across a room and seeing each other for the first ever time. The love story is there and that‚Äôs enough for me. I usually don‚Äôt like sad stories, or anything sad, so I‚Äôd avoid books like this. I didn‚Äôt read it straight away. Because of my dislike of anything and everything sad I wasn‚Äôt interested in reading it at all until the movie came out in 2014. As a good bibliophile I refused to see the movie before reading the book. I wanted to watch the movie so much I read the book. It was heart breaking but somehow worth it. I thought ‚ÄúMarley and Me‚Äù would be the last. I would have read it one way or another if a movie didn‚Äôt exist. It has such high views I would have for curiosity. ‚ÄúThe Fault in Our Stars‚Äù is as close to a perfect tragedy as it is to rain two days together in Ireland. <br/>Love and tragedy are commonly put together. In a tragedy you have the build up to the high point when the protagonists of the story are falling in love. The climax would be when they fall in love. And then the drop, everything goes down. Romeo is banished and when Hazel‚Äôs lifespan is catching up to her. Cancer for Hazel and Gus is the antagonist in this story. It‚Äôs a race for them to do as much as possible with each other before their time is up. I think this sets their relationship quite fast paced and passionate. Hazel is driven to go to Amsterdam and visit the author of her favourite book, Peter Van Houten. <br/>Van Houten plays a crucial part in this novel. He‚Äôs in a bad spot when Gus and Hazel arrive at his house. From the moment he answered the door he was a let-down. He slammed it in their facs and left them waiting on his doorstep. Then he proceeded to tell his assistant that they were ‚Äúadolescent apparitions‚Äù at his door. Maybe he knew this but Gus and Hazel could hear his conversation through the door. After his assistant Lidewiji convinced him that they were planned to come they were let in and offered a seat and a cocktail. He drinks scotch and water while Hazel queries him about the novel. He doesn‚Äôt have an answer and is consistently rude. Hazel can‚Äôt stand it so she leaves with Gus following close behind. Gus teaches Van Houten about life and what it is to live. How much he loves it however short lived. He tells him to get his act together for Hazel‚Äôs sake. This happens in the ending. He pulls himself together enough to attend Gus‚Äô funeral and pass on Gus‚Äô to Hazel. They mourn together. <br/>Everything together in the novel shows you so much. It has the old tragedy with a modern twist of cancer and the romance. There is no better ending to this book them is what is on the final page. Despite the sadness I gained a lot from this read. Although many of the things it outlines in life are obvious it does not mean they don‚Äôt need to be heard. It reminds us of them and shows us an ending of a tale of people who lived by these obvious quotes.",TRUE,,1,1
